# GIT WORK STRUCTURE
## 🔧 Developer Branches

Each developer works in their own branch:

- Akshat → `dev_akshat`
- Ashu   → `dev_ashu`
- Sanyam → `dev_sanyam`

### ⚙️ Workflow
1. Checkout your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev_akshat   # or dev_ashu / dev_sanyam

   
#  React Node Express App

This project is a full-stack application built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. It serves as a template for creating modern web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-node-express-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the React client:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000` for the React frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the Express backend.

## Usage

You can modify the React components in the `client/src` directory and the Express routes in the `server/src/routes` directory to fit your application's needs.
